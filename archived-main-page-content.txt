Name: Jeremy Cyr
Title: Software Architect & Engineering Leader

Description:
I help companies turn complex technical challenges into scalable, business-aligned solutions. With over 15 years of experience leading enterprise development, I specialize in system integration, platform modernization, large-scale migrations, and greenfield builds that drive real impact.

I bridge strategy and executionâ€”partnering with product and engineering teams to reduce costs, accelerate time-to-market, and unlock new revenue opportunities through thoughtful architecture and pragmatic delivery.

I selectively partner on consulting engagements where there's clear alignment and the potential for significant results.
