**Technical Focus Areas:**
- Enterprise Integration (ERP, Commerce, CRM)

- API & Microservices Design
- System Modernization & Refactoring
- DevOps & Infrastructure as Code

## Approach & Philosophy

Whether I’m mapping out a new event-driven architecture, guiding a proof-of-concept, or helping an existing team bridge legacy and modern systems, I’m deeply engaged in the work and comfortable navigating complexity.

**I focus on:**
- Business-aligned architecture
- Iterative, maintainable delivery
- Future-ready system design
- Clear communication and documentation

## Consulting Focus & Ideal Projects

I specialize in consulting engagements where architecture and hands-on leadership can unlock clear business value. My ideal projects involve collaborating with internal teams or agency partners to deliver results quickly and effectively—whether it's a proof-of-concept, a modernization roadmap, or integration of complex systems.

I typically work with:
- Mid-sized enterprises seeking to modernize systems, integrate platforms, or launch new digital initiatives  
- Internal teams needing fractional architecture leadership or hands-on POC/MVP delivery  
- Agencies and consultancies looking to subcontract experienced, adaptable technical leadership

**If you need a partner who can blend architecture, delivery, and business insight—I’d love to connect.**
