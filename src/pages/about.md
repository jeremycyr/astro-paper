With over a 15 years of experience architecting enterprise-scale solutions, I specialize in transforming complex business challenges into scalable, streamlined technology ecosystems. I bridge strategic vision with hands-on delivery—consistently delivering ahead of schedule while driving measurable business outcomes.

## Core Expertise

My work focuses on enterprise system integration and cloud architecture, particularly across ERP, commerce, and CRM platforms. I design event-driven, cloud-native systems that modernize legacy infrastructure without disrupting business continuity—leveraging AWS and Azure to deliver scalable, resilient platforms.

**Technical Focus Areas:**
- Enterprise Integration Architecture (ERP, Commerce, CRM)
- Cloud Architecture & Migration (AWS, Azure)
- Event-Driven Architecture Patterns
- Legacy System Modernization
- API Design & Microservices Architecture
- Full-Stack Development (Multiple Technologies)
- DevOps & Infrastructure Automation

## Approach & Philosophy

I believe great architecture is rooted in business context. I work closely with stakeholders to understand not just what needs to be built, but why it matters. My goal is to deliver practical, forward-looking solutions that provide immediate value and lay the groundwork for long-term growth.

**My methodology emphasizes:**
- **Business-First Architecture**: Every decision tied to ROI and business goals  
- **Iterative Delivery**: Breaking work into clear, manageable phases  
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Empowering teams to maintain and evolve solutions  
- **Future-Proofing**: Designing adaptable systems built to scale and change

## Selective Engagements

I work with medium-sized enterprises seeking to modernize their infrastructure, integrate complex systems, and align technology with strategy. I take on a limited number of consulting engagements where architecture has the potential to drive clear business value.

**Current Focus Areas:**
- Enterprise system integration and modernization  
- Cloud migration and architecture optimization  
- Legacy transformation strategies  
- E-commerce and digital platform delivery  
- Workflow and process automation

I'm particularly drawn to projects where thoughtful architecture enables measurable business impact—whether through new revenue, operational efficiency, or better customer experiences.
