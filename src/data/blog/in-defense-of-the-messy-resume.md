It's a question that I hear a lot: What makes a Senior Developer? What makes a Staff Developer? What makes an Architect? "Why do you ask?" I'll probe, and the result is often revealing: "I want to know how to get to the next level." or "I'm wondering if I'm ready to be a Senior."

**Goodhart's Law:** When a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good metric. Or more casually: "If you make a game, people will play it."

It's little wonder—we like sequences and structure as humans, and we've made ourselves a lot of them. Be sure to volunteer, it'll look good on your college applications. Get the right internship, that'll lead to an offer. Pick the right company. Promote up that ladder, Junior > Dev > Senior. Make a Strategic Company Change. Staff > Principal > Manager > Director. Another Strategic Company Change. VP > CTO etc. You can't have any gaps on your resume, it might look like nobody wanted you!

The reality is that "messy" careers are often an indicator of something very important: curiosity. And having an active and developed curiosity is a massive distinct advantage, especially in any field that focuses on solving problems, which is well, most of them.

## Wait, we're all woodworkers?!

I was once seated at a conference table during a break at a long requirements gathering session for a project. The group was mostly talented technical people in a variety of domains. Making small talk, someone mentioned that they were a woodworker. One by one, people all around the table revealed that they too were a woodworker, and added some context about their shop, tools, etc. The group laughed awkwardly as each additional person chimed in with their bit of unexpected common thread.

The phenomenon makes sense: in woodworking there are endless challenges and aspects to explore. You get to both build something, and always be learning or trying some new aspect. You get to try, fail, and improve. The feedback loop is quick and very real. In total: it feeds curiosity. And talented engineers more often than not are curious folks.

This wasn't just a funny coincidence. It was a room full of people whose curiosity doesn't stop at work. Their instinct to explore, build, and solve problems shows up everywhere—including their careers. This curiosity is not just a trait shared by good engineers, it's what makes them good engineers.

## The Book of Rhymes

There's a saying: History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. Experience works the same way.

The more problems you solve, the more familiar they begin to feel. Different industries, different projects—but underneath, the same core dynamics appear again and again.

That's your "book of rhymes." It's a growing collection of mental patterns—past successes, close calls, and hard-won lessons that quietly guide your judgment.

It's not about memorizing trivia. It's about recognizing the familiar: deadlines that slip, risks that escalate, shortcuts that backfire. The more varied your domains and experiences, the more dense and useful your book becomes.

And this is where curiosity pays off. Every detour, every side project, every strange challenge you take on builds that book. Curiosity isn't just a way to explore new things—it's how you gather the raw material for future insight.

## Ladder [Optional]

It's fine to think about titles and levels—they exist for a reason. But the real "next level" isn't something you reach by a carefully choreographed ascension. It comes from following your curiosity, taking on unexpected challenges, and slowly building up your book of rhymes. That's where the real leverage lies—whether or not it shows up neatly on your résumé.

The best engineers I know didn't get there by playing the ladder game. They got there by staying curious, trying odd things, and learning from every messy step along the way—producing results that can't be ignored.

And if you're leading teams, it's worth remembering: those "messy" career histories—full of detours, gaps, and unusual projects—are often where your most adaptable, resourceful people come from. The ones with the broadest books of rhymes are usually the ones who quietly solve the hardest problems.
